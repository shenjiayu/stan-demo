# How to run
1. git clone this project
2. cd into the base folder
3. run ```npm i -s``` to install all dependencies
4. run ```npm start``` to review it
5. run ```npm test``` to run some basic testings (might need to press ```a``` to run all testings)

# Q & A
*How did you decide which technologies to use as part of your solution?*

First of all, I use the ```create-react-app``` to scaffold the entire structure.
1. For the **implementation**, obviously ```React``` is the required UI library with only pure CSS, and I also utilise the ```React Router``` to do navigations which makes the UX a bit smoother.
2. For the **testing** part, I use the built-in testing framework to do the most basic testings with the help of enzyme from airbnb to manipulate the DOM.

*Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?*

1. I could of using flexbox to sketch out the layout completely.
2. Code coverage can be increased much more.
3. Some new features of React 16 can be used, such as Error Handler for error reporting or displaying.
4. The source code complexity can be shrinked down to another level in terms of the code in the render function for both **series** and **movies** screens.

*What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?*
